// [NEW] Logic for conversational interaction
export async function haveConversation(chatHistory) {
  const system = `You are Nether AI, an expert presentation strategist. Your goal is to help users craft the perfect presentation by having a natural conversation.

  **Your process is as follows:**
  1.  **Engage and Clarify:** Start by understanding the user's needs. Ask clarifying questions about their topic, audience, goals, and desired tone. Be friendly, concise, and helpful.
  2.  **Analyze:** Analyze the user's responses from the chat history.
  3.  **Decide When to Generate:** Once you have a clear understanding of the topic AND the intended audience, you can proceed to generate strategic angles. Do NOT generate angles prematurely if you lack key information.
  4.  **Generate Angles:** When ready, generate 4 diverse, compelling strategic angles for the presentation.
  
  **Output Format Rules:**
  - Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
  - If you are asking a question or making a statement to continue the conversation, use this format:
    {
      "response_type": "text",
      "content": "Your text response here."
    }
  - If you have gathered enough information and are ready to provide the strategic angles, use this format:
    {
      "response_type": "angles",
      "content": {
        "angles": [
          { "angle_id": "angle_1", "title": "Angle Title 1", "key_points": ["Point A", "Point B", "Point C"] },
          { "angle_id": "angle_2", "title": "Angle Title 2", "key_points": ["Point D", "Point E", "Point F"] },
          { "angle_id": "angle_3", "title": "Angle Title 3", "key_points": ["Point G", "Point H", "Point I"] },

        ]
      }
    }
  
  **Example Conversation Flow:**
  - User: "I need to make a presentation about our new software."
  - You: (Returns text response) { "response_type": "text", "content": "Sounds great! Who will you be presenting this to? Are they technical users, executives, or potential customers?" }
  - User: "It's for potential customers."
  - You: (Returns angles response) { "response_type": "angles", "content": { "angles": [...] } }`;

  const user = `
Generate 4 strategic angles for a presentation on the topic: "${topic}".

**ANGLE SELECTION STRATEGY:**
Choose 4 diverse angles from these proven storytelling frameworks, adapting them to fit the topic:

**Business/Product Topics:**
- "The Innovation Journey" (origin story, evolution, breakthroughs)
- "The Competitive Edge" (market position, differentiators, advantages)
- "The User Impact" (customer success, transformation, value delivered)
- "The Future Vision" (roadmap, emerging trends, next chapter)

**Educational/Informational Topics:**
- "The Foundation" (core concepts, principles, building blocks)
- "The Real-World Application" (practical uses, case studies, examples)
- "The Common Challenges" (problems solved, obstacles overcome)
- "The Expert Insights" (advanced techniques, best practices, pro tips)

**Industry/Market Topics:**
- "The Current Landscape" (market overview, key players, trends)
- "The Transformation Story" (how things have changed, disruption)
- "The Opportunities Ahead" (growth areas, emerging markets, potential)
- "The Strategic Approach" (how to succeed, winning strategies)

**REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Each angle must have a compelling, action-oriented title (4-8 words max)
2. Each angle must include 3 specific, concrete key points (not generic statements)
3. Angles should appeal to different audience interests and learning styles
4. Include visual storytelling potential in your angle selection
5. Ensure angles can support 8-12 slides of rich content each

**ENHANCED SCHEMA WITH VISUAL HINTS:**
{
  "angles": [
    {
      "angle_id": "angle_1_[category]",
      "title": "Compelling Action-Oriented Title",
      "key_points": [
        "Specific, concrete point with measurable impact",
        "Unique insight or surprising fact about the topic",
        "Clear benefit or outcome for the audience"
      ],
      "visual_theme": "suggested visual approach (e.g., 'timeline', 'comparison', 'process', 'data-driven')",
      "audience_appeal": "primary audience motivation (e.g., 'decision-makers', 'technical-experts', 'general-audience')"

  const system = `You are a world-class presentation designer and storyteller. Your task is to create a complete visual and narrative blueprint for a presentation of exactly ${slideCount} slides.

  RULES:
  1.  **Structure is Mandatory:** The blueprint MUST begin with a 'Title' slide (slide 1) and an 'Agenda' slide (slide 2), and end with a 'Closing', 'Thank You', or 'Q&A' slide. This structure is non-negotiable.
  2.  **Angle-Adapted Narrative:** You MUST adapt the narrative flow of the content slides to fit the chosen angle's title: "${angle?.title || ''}".
      - If the angle is historical (e.g., "The Innovation Story"), use a chronological flow.
      - If the angle is persuasive (e.g., "Why We Will Win"), use a Problem/Solution flow.
      - If the angle is explanatory (e.g., "A Guide to our Products"), use a thematic or sequential flow.
  3.  **Visual Design is Key:** For EACH slide, you MUST specify a 'visual_element'. This tells the designer HOW to lay out the content.
  4.  **Image Integration:** For content slides (not Title/Agenda), STRONGLY consider adding an 'image_suggestion' when it would enhance understanding. Be specific about what type of image would work best (e.g., 'professional team meeting', 'modern data visualization', 'futuristic technology concept').
  5.  **Available Visual Elements:** ['TitleSlide', 'Agenda', 'TwoColumn', 'Quote', 'SectionHeader', 'FeatureGrid', 'ProcessDiagram', 'DataChart', 'Timeline', 'ComparisonTable', 'TeamMembers', 'KpiGrid'].

  Your output MUST be ONLY the valid JSON object matching this exact schema:
  {
    "slides": [{
      "slide_id": "string",
      "slide_title": "string",
      "objective": "string",
      "content_points": ["string"],

    "designSystem": ${JSON.stringify(designSystem || {})}

    // This is the blueprint for the SINGLE slide you must design.
    "slideBlueprint": ${JSON.stringify(slideBlueprint || {})}

      "KpiGrid", "FullBleedImageLayout", "TitleAndBulletsLayout", "ContactInfoLayout", "TeamMembers"
    ]

    **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - YOU MUST FOLLOW ALL OF THESE:**

    1.  **CHOOSE THE BEST LAYOUT:** Select the MOST appropriate layout from 'availableLayouts' that fits the blueprint's intent:
        - 'TitleSlide': Only for slide 1 (presentation title)
        - 'Agenda': Only for slide 2 (presentation outline)
        - 'TitleAndBulletsLayout': For simple content lists, key points
        - 'TwoColumn': For content with supporting images or side-by-side comparisons
        - 'FeatureGrid': For showcasing 3-4 features, benefits, or services
        - 'ProcessDiagram': For step-by-step processes, workflows, timelines
        - 'DataChart': For statistics, metrics, quantitative data
        - 'ComparisonTable': For feature comparisons, before/after, pros/cons
        - 'FullBleedImageLayout': For impactful section breaks, emotional content
        - 'Quote': For testimonials, key quotes, mission statements
        - 'KpiGrid': For key performance indicators, metrics dashboard
        - 'ContactInfoLayout': Only for final slide (contact/thank you)
        - 'SectionHeader': For major section transitions
        - 'TeamMembers': For introducing team, leadership, speakers

    2.  **EXPAND THE CONTENT (MANDATORY):** Do not just copy the 'content_points'. You MUST elaborate on them.
        - Write an introductory 'body' paragraph (2-3 sentences) that sets the context for the slide.
        - The original 'content_points' should be used as a 'bullets' or 'items' array.

    3.  **GENERATE SPEAKER NOTES (MANDATORY):** For EVERY slide, you MUST write 2-4 sentences of insightful 'speaker_notes'. These should contain extra details, data, or talking points not visible on the slide.

    4.  **CREATE CONTEXTUAL DATA (IF APPLICABLE):** If you choose 'DataChart', 'KpiGrid', or 'ComparisonTable', you MUST generate realistic and contextually relevant data based on the slide's topic. DO NOT use generic placeholder data.

    5.  **SUGGEST CONTEXTUAL ICONS (IF APPLICABLE):** If the layout is 'FeatureGrid' or 'ProcessDiagram', for each item/feature, you MUST suggest a relevant icon name from the 'lucide-react' library (e.g., "TrendingUp", "ShieldCheck", "Users"). Add it as an 'icon' property to each feature object.

    6.  **CREATE ARTISTIC IMAGE PROMPTS:** If the slide requires an image ('TwoColumn', 'FullBleedImageLayout'), create a highly specific and artistic 'image_prompt' based on slide type:
        - For business/corporate slides: 'professional team collaboration, modern office, cinematic lighting'
        - For technology slides: 'futuristic digital interface, holographic displays, neon lighting, 3D render'
        - For data/analytics slides: 'abstract data visualization, flowing charts, geometric patterns, blue tones'
        - For timeline slides: 'journey concept, pathway, progression, minimalist design'
        - For comparison slides: 'balance concept, scales, versus imagery, clean composition'
        - For closing slides: 'success celebration, handshake, achievement, warm lighting'
        - Always include style keywords like 'photorealistic', 'cinematic lighting', 'professional photography', '4K quality', 'modern aesthetic'. Otherwise, set to null.

    7.  **USE LAYOUT OPTIONS DYNAMICALLY:** For the 'TwoColumn' layout, randomly choose to set an 'imagePosition' property to either 'left' or 'right' to create visual variety in the presentation.

    8.  **CHOOSE A BACKGROUND:** Select the most fitting background variant from 'designSystem.gradients'. Use 'background_title' for 'TitleSlide' and 'FullBleedImageLayout'. Use 'background_subtle' for text-heavy slides like 'TitleAndBulletsLayout'. Default to 'background_default' for others.

    **YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE A SINGLE, VALID JSON OBJECT. NO MARKDOWN, NO COMMENTARY.**
    
    **EXAMPLE FOR A 'FeatureGrid' SLIDE:**
